Handle Edge Cases                       Implementation Details
  - Divisor = 0                           - Make both numbers positive
  - Integer Overflow                      - Track sign of result
  - Negative Numbers                      - Use bit shift operations
                                          - Handle overflow conditions
```

## Detailed Sections

### 1. Problem Statement
- **Challenge**: Given two integers (dividend and divisor), perform division without using the division operator
- **Expected Output**: Return the integer quotient (truncate decimal part)
- **Constraints**:
  - Integers are in the range [-2³¹, 2³¹-1]
  - Divisor will never be zero
  - If result exceeds integer range, return 2³¹-1 (INTEGER_MAX)

### 2. Naive Approach: Repeated Subtraction
- **Basic Idea**: Repeatedly subtract the divisor from dividend and count how many times
- **Algorithm**:
  ```java
  int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {
      int sum = 0;
      int counter = 0;
      while (sum + divisor <= dividend) {
          sum += divisor;
          counter++;
      }
      return counter;
  }
  ```
- **Time Complexity**: O(dividend), which is inefficient for large numbers
- **Example**: Dividing 22 by 3
  - Add 3 repeatedly: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21
  - Cannot add more threes (21 + 3 > 22)
  - Counter = 7, so 22 ÷ 3 = 7

### 3. Optimized Approach: Powers of 2
- **Key Insight**: Any quotient can be decomposed into a sum of powers of 2
- **Binary Representation**: 7 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 2² + 2¹ + 2⁰

#### 3.1 Forward Engineering Approach
- Start removing the largest possible multiple of divisor (in powers of 2)
- **Example**: Divide 22 by 3
  1. Check 3×2⁰=3 (can remove)
  2. Check 3×2¹=6 (can remove)
  3. Check 3×2²=12 (can remove)
  4. Check 3×2³=24 (cannot remove, too large)
  5. Remove 12 from 22, left with 10
  6. Again check what power of 2 multiple of 3 can be removed from 10
  7. Remove 6 (3×2¹), left with 4
  8. Remove 3 (3×2⁰), left with 1
  9. 1 < 3, so stop
  10. Total powers: 2² + 2¹ + 2⁰ = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7

### 4. Handling Edge Cases

#### 4.1 Negative Numbers
- Result is negative when:
  - Only one of dividend or divisor is negative
- Result is positive when:
  - Both dividend and divisor have the same sign
- Implementation approach:
  - Convert both numbers to positive
  - Track sign separately
  - Apply sign to final result

#### 4.2 Handling Overflow
- Special case: If dividend = -2³¹ and divisor = -1
  - Result would be 2³¹, which exceeds integer range
  - Return 2³¹-1 (INTEGER_MAX) in this case
- Use long type to prevent overflows during calculations

### 5. Algorithm Implementation

```java
public int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {
    // Handle edge case for equal numbers
    if (dividend == divisor) {
        return 1;
    }
    
    // Determine sign of result
    boolean sign = true; // true means positive
    if ((dividend > 0 && divisor < 0) || (dividend < 0 && divisor > 0)) {
        sign = false;
    }
    
    // Convert to positive using long to handle MIN_VALUE
    long n = Math.abs((long)dividend);
    long d = Math.abs((long)divisor);
    
    // Perform division using bit manipulation
    long answer = 0;
    while (n >= d) {
        long count = 0;
        while (n >= (d << (count + 1))) {
            count++;
        }
        answer += (1L << count);
        n -= (d << count);
    }
    
    // Handle overflow
    if (answer > Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
        return sign ? Integer.MAX_VALUE : Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    }
    
    // Apply sign
    return sign ? (int)answer : -(int)answer;
}
```

### 6. Time and Space Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(log² n)
  - Outer loop: O(log n) - reducing dividend in powers of 2
  - Inner loop: O(log n) - finding largest power of 2
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - using constant extra space

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Divide 22 by 3
```
Initialize: 
  - dividend = 22, divisor = 3
  - n = 22, d = 3, sign = true (positive)

Iteration 1:
  - Find largest power of 2 where d << count <= n
  - 3 << 0 = 3 ✓
  - 3 << 1 = 6 ✓
  - 3 << 2 = 12 ✓
  - 3 << 3 = 24 ✗ (too large)
  - Use count = 2 (largest valid)
  - answer += (1 << 2) = 4
  - n = 22 - 12 = 10

Iteration 2:
  - Find largest power of 2 where d << count <= n
  - 3 << 0 = 3 ✓
  - 3 << 1 = 6 ✓
  - 3 << 2 = 12 ✗ (too large)
  - Use count = 1 (largest valid)
  - answer += (1 << 1) = 2
  - n = 10 - 6 = 4

Iteration 3:
  - Find largest power of 2 where d << count <= n
  - 3 << 0 = 3 ✓
  - 3 << 1 = 6 ✗ (too large)
  - Use count = 0 (largest valid)
  - answer += (1 << 0) = 1
  - n = 4 - 3 = 1

n = 1 < d = 3, so we stop
Final answer = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7
```

### Example 2: Divide -100 by 8
```
Initialize:
  - dividend = -100, divisor = 8
  - n = 100, d = 8, sign = false (negative)

Iteration 1:
  - Find largest power of 2 where d << count <= n
  - 8 << 0 = 8 ✓
  - 8 << 1 = 16 ✓
  - 8 << 2 = 32 ✓
  - 8 << 3 = 64 ✓
  - 8 << 4 = 128 ✗ (too large)
  - Use count = 3 (largest valid)
  - answer += (1 << 3) = 8
  - n = 100 - 64 = 36

Iteration 2:
  - Find largest power of 2 where d << count <= n
  - 8 << 0 = 8 ✓
  - 8 << 1 = 16 ✓
  - 8 << 2 = 32 ✓
  - 8 << 3 = 64 ✗ (too large)
  - Use count = 2 (largest valid)
  - answer += (1 << 2) = 4
  - n = 36 - 32 = 4

Iteration 3:
  - n = 4 < d = 8, so we stop

Final answer = 8 + 4 = 12
Apply sign: -12
```

## Advanced Notes / Behind the Scenes

### Binary Long Division Connection
The optimized algorithm is actually implementing binary long division, similar to the decimal long division we learn in school, but in base-2:

```
Decimal long division:  Binary long division:
  _____                   _____
7 )22          would be  11)10110  (in binary)
  21                       11
  --                       --
   1                       10
                           0
                           --
                           101
                           11
                           --
                           10
                           0
                           --
                           10
```

### Hardware Implementation
Modern CPUs implement division using similar techniques:
- Restoring division algorithm
- Non-restoring division algorithm
- SRT division algorithm

These hardware implementations also use shift operations and comparisons rather than actual division operations at the transistor level.
